# USB port

after opening the Trifo max model two USB ports were found. one USB A, and one micro usb port.

# USB A
this port does not seem not to be connected. If a keyboard is connected and the capslock key is pressed, the capslock indicator does not turn on.


# Micro USB (picture available [here](https://github.com/VictorDrijkoningen/trifo-robotics-rev-eng/blob/04a331fae4f84ecbf3329fd335d6889a67002bb7/Trifo-Max%20V1.1%20Pictures/Main%20Chips.jpg) )
when the Max model is turned on and the micro usb port is connected to a computer, the computer does not see the max model in any way. This seems to suggest there is another protocol on this port.
