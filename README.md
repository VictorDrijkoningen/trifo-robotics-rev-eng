# Trifo Robot Vacuums without an app
~~Trifo Robotics seems to have gone down under.~~ This is my documentation on restoring functionality.
This page is at the moment primarily focused on the Trifo Max model (V1.1). 

Edit: the apps are now working again. This research will still be ongoing to create another way of accessing the device. This could be used to create a homeassistant plugin that controls the robot.

I found [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/RobotVacuums/comments/1d1120l/trifo_robotics_appears_to_have_gone_under_they/) thread after discovery my vaccuum did not have a working app anymore. This started research into accessing the robot software in another way.


# Goal
The main goal of this repo is to ~~restore~~ recreate the functionality the app had in some way (For example planning weekly cleaning sessions etc.)
